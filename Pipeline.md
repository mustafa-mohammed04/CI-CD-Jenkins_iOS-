# to automate iOS native Xcode app with a Jenkins pipeline

1. Jenkins Setup

    Install Jenkins: Ensure Jenkins is installed on a Mac machine since iOS builds require macOS and Xcode. You can download Jenkins from the official website and follow the installation instructions.
    Install Required Plugins: In Jenkins, install necessary plugins such as Git, Xcode integration, and any other plugins you might find useful for your workflow.

2. Xcode Project Preparation

    Code Signing: Ensure your Xcode project is properly configured for code signing. You might need to use manual signing with a provisioning profile and a certificate that Jenkins can access.
    Shared Scheme: Your Xcode project should have a shared scheme for the build process, as Jenkins will use this scheme to build your app.

3. Jenkins Pipeline Creation

    Create a New Pipeline: In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job. You will be prompted to configure this job in the next steps.
    Source Code Management: Configure the pipeline to fetch your iOS app's source code from where it's hosted (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket). You'll need to provide repository URLs and credentials if necessary.

4. Writing the Jenkinsfile

    Jenkinsfile: This is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into the source control repository. Here's a basic example of what this file might look like for an iOS project

``` groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh 'pod install' // If you're using CocoaPods
            }
        }
        stage('Build and Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Adjust the following command according to your project setup
                    sh 'xcodebuild -workspace YourApp.xcworkspace -scheme YourScheme -sdk iphoneos -configuration Release build test'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Archive and Export') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Adjust paths and options as necessary
                    sh 'xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath ${WORKSPACE}/build/YourApp.xcarchive -exportPath ${WORKSPACE}/build -exportOptionsPlist exportOptions.plist'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

    Adapt the Jenkinsfile: The above script is a basic template. You will need to adapt it to your project's specifics, like workspace and scheme names, as well as any additional steps like running unit tests or deploying to a distribution service like TestFlight.

5. Configure Build Triggers

    You can configure Jenkins to automatically trigger builds on various events, such as code pushes to your repository, on a schedule, or manually.

6. Running the Pipeline

    Execute the Pipeline: Once everything is set up, you can run the pipeline. Jenkins will execute each stage defined in your Jenkinsfile, outputting logs that you can monitor for success or failure

Jenkins Plugins for iOS Projects

    Xcode Integration Plugin: This plugin is crucial for iOS projects as it provides Jenkins with the capability to execute Xcode-related tasks, such as building your Xcode projects or workspaces, packaging, and exporting your apps for distribution.

    Git Plugin: If your source code is hosted in a Git repository, the Git plugin allows Jenkins to pull the codebase for building. This is essential for almost all projects given the prevalence of Git.

    Credentials Plugin: This plugin helps manage credentials like SSH keys and API tokens that Jenkins might need to access other services, like your source code repository or third-party APIs for notifications, testing services, etc.

    CocoaPods Plugin: If your iOS project depends on CocoaPods for managing external libraries, the CocoaPods plugin can automate the process of installing those dependencies before the build process begins.

    Keychains and Provisioning Profiles Plugin: Managing code signing in CI/CD can be challenging. This plugin helps manage macOS keychains and iOS provisioning profiles required for building and signing your iOS applications.

Installing Plugins in Jenkins

To install these plugins, follow these steps:

    Access Jenkins Dashboard: Log in to your Jenkins server's web interface.

    Navigate to Manage Jenkins: Find the "Manage Jenkins" option in the dashboard menu and click on it.

    Go to Manage Plugins: Look for the "Manage Plugins" option and select it. You'll be taken to a page where you can manage your Jenkins plugins.

    Find the Plugins: Switch to the "Available" tab to see a list of plugins that you can install. You can use the search bar at the top right of the page to find the plugins mentioned above.

    Select and Install: Check the box next to each plugin you want to install, then click the "Install without restart" button at the bottom of the page. Jenkins will download and install the selected plugins.

    Restart Jenkins if Required: Some plugins might require a restart of Jenkins to complete the installation. Jenkins usually prompts you if a restart is needed.

After Installation

    Configure Plugins: After installation, some plugins might require additional configuration. For example, the Credentials Plugin will need you to add your credentials, and the Xcode Integration plugin might require setting up default Xcode paths or specific build settings.

    Global and Job-Specific Configuration: Some plugin settings can be configured globally (for all jobs) or specifically for individual jobs. Check both the global configuration settings in "Manage Jenkins" and the job-specific settings when you configure your pipeline or freestyle jobs.

    Check Plugin Documentation: Most Jenkins plugins come with documentation that provides more detailed instructions on configuration and usage. It's highly recommended to refer to these documents to get the most out of the plugins you've installed.

Following these steps should equip your Jenkins environment with the necessary plugins to automate builds, tests, and deployments for iOS applications, streamlining your CI/CD pipeline.
